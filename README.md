# UFOs

## Overview
Our goal was to build a webpage where people can read data about UFO sightings. However, after building the webpage, it was vague and confusing. We want to edit the data to provide a more in depth analysis of UFO sightings. We will create multiple filters so readers can better understand where and when they spotted the UFOs. 

## Results

Above is the different filters used to read the data. You are able to search by date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO to find what you're looking for. In the search boxes there are sample searches to get you started. 

## Summary
We successfully established a webpage that will help UFO enthusiasts read about in depth sightings of UFOs. I think that it still might be difficult for individuals to search for specific sightings they want to learn more about. If we add a new filter such as time of sighting, it will help people with their searches. I also think we could increase the usability of the website, and make it more aesthetic to viewers. We could change the font, or add a different background to make it more aesthetic to readers.
