# UFOs

## Overview
Our goal was to build a webpage where people can read data about UFO sightings. However, after building the webpage, it was vague and confusing. We want to edit the data to provide a more in depth analysis of UFO sightings. We will create multiple filters so readers can better understand where and when they spotted the UFOs.

Above is the different filters used to read the data. You are able to search by date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO to find what you're looking for. In the search boxes there are sample searches to get you started.
